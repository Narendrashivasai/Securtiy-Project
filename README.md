The main theme of prevention and providing security to atm from atm robberies. Now a days 
these atm robberies are common and frequently occurred .For example, stolen money from 
atm by damaging atm machines. Now we want to deals with prevention of atm thefts and 
providing security to atm machines from atm robberies. Whenever robbery occurs we used 
sensors which helps us to produce beep sound from buzzers. The entire scenario was 
recorded by camera ,which is sending video continuously to pc and it will be saved in 
computer. By using some hardware components, the entire scenario, robbery occurred time 
and its location send to near by police station and corresponding bank. In the other hand if the 
thief tries to break the door or damage the camera then immediately atm responds to send the 
alert messages to the nearby police station, and corresponding bank.
