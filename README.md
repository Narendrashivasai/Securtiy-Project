Whenever robbery occurs we used sensors which helps us to produce beep sound from buzzers.
The entire scenario was recorded by camera ,which is sending video continuously to pc and it will be saved in computer. 
By using some hardware components, the entire scenario, robbery occurred time and its location send to near by police station and corresponding bank.
 In the other hand if the thief tries to break the door or damage the camera then immediately atm responds to send the alert messages to the nearby police station, and corresponding bank.
